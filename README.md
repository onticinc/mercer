<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<br>

Mercer is a crowdsourced online marketplace powered by everyday entrepreneurs (like you!). From the latest and greatest in high-end electronics, to rare and unexpected collectibles and antiques, you’re only a few clicks away from discovering yet another amazing deal. <br><br>

Mercer was built for our vendors - making it fun, fast, and easy to quickly list and trade whatever they'd like, in bulk. We believe that as we continue to improve our vendor store management system, we’re providing an even more amazing customer experience as a result.
Have a look around, and see for yourself!
Est. 2022

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/onticinc/mercer.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Fork the backend from [this repository](https://github.com/RolandYambao/mercers-api)

4. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/onticinc/mercer.git
   ```
4. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
5. Create a .env file in the front and backend. Set your  mongo SRV with 
    ```
    MONGO_URI
    ```
    example: 
    ```
    MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv:// ... (etc)
    ```
    then, similarly - add 
    ```
    JWT_SECRET= 
    ```
    to your .env files and assign it your own value.
6. Now on both the front and backend, run:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    You should now be able to view and interact with your local copy of the Mercers app!

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

A Mercer vendor is able to create a sale associated with a niche or theme. For example, a user-seller (vendor) wants to clear out their man-cave. On Mercer, they are able to promote and market their inventory for a particular category based on these themes or niche associations. 

Our intention was to create an environment for buyers and sellers to connect on a local scale. We believe this relationship would lead to a better experience on both ends, and create a more efficient circulation of products in the after-market. 

Mercer is a fun and easy way to find great deals on awesome resale items, and it also encourages users to recirculate items they might otherwise throw away.

<!-- TECHNOLOGIES USED -->

## Technologies Used

## Node.js
- As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. In the following "hello world" example, many connections can be handled concurrently. Upon each connection, the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done, Node.js will sleep.

## React

- React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.

## Axios
- Axios, which is a popular library is mainly used to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints. This library is very useful to perform CRUD operations.
- This popular library is used to communicate with the backend. Axios supports the Promise API, native to JS ES6.
- Using Axios we make API requests in our application. Once the request is made we get the data in Return, and then we use this data in our project. 
- This library is very popular among developers.

## MongoDB
- MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented database that is designed to store a large scale of data and also allows you to work with that data very efficiently.
- MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time
- The document model maps to the objects in your application code, making data easy to work with
- Ad hoc queries, indexing, and real time aggregation provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data

## bcrypt
- bcrypt is a password-hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David Mazières, based on the Blowfish cipher and presented at USENIX in 1999. Besides incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is an adaptive function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower, so it remains resistant to brute-force search attacks even with increasing computation power.

<!-- GENERAL APPROACH -->

## General Approach

Our frontend and backend teams collaboratively built the idea for Mercer. We wanted an online-store application where we could innovate on ideas we thought could interact well on a single platform.

We began by creating our wireframe and laying out our user stories. With these as the foundation, our backend team built out the database tools necessary to provide functionality to the app. Our frontend began creating components and pages to address the requirements we had produced from our wireframes. 

Over time, the backend was connected in these pages and components, and the basic functionality of the app emerged. From there, both teams worked to add the more complex (but awesome) features we’d set out to create. Up until the time of our deployment, we continued working to build out and improve our UI and UX.

<!-- ROADBLOCKS -->

## Roadblocks

Frontend:
- Creating a functional map tool to allow users to view how near/far they are from the listings. We were able to produce the nonfunctional map element on the app, but making it functional in our timeframe was not tenable.

- Bidding/Haggling/Reservation interaction. We wanted to allow potential buyers to post their best offer on an item, or make counteroffers, or pay extra to the seller to be able to reserve a product. We did not have enough time during the timeframe to attempt to implement these features.

- Instant-listing. We wanted sellers to be able to take a big mass of things they want to sell (a ton of old equipment in the garage, for example), whip out their phone - and make dozens of listings quickly and easily. We did not have the time to address this functionality.

Backend:
